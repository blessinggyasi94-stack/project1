# Push to GitHub - Final Step

## Run this command:

```bash
cd /Users/franknambeh/Desktop/Neuro.ai/Neurologist_consultant/repo
git push -u origin main
```

## When prompted:

1. **Username:** `blessinggyasi94-stack`
2. **Password:** Enter the **Personal Access Token** (not the account password!)

## If you don't have a Personal Access Token:

1. Log into blessinggyasi94-stack's GitHub account
2. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
3. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
4. Name: "Project Upload"
5. Select scope: **`repo`** (full control of private repositories)
6. Click "Generate token"
7. **Copy the token immediately** (you won't see it again!)
8. Use this token as the password when git prompts you

## Alternative: Push with token in URL (one-time)

If you have the token, you can also use:

```bash
git push https://blessinggyasi94-stack:YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/blessinggyasi94-stack/project.git main
```

Replace `YOUR_TOKEN` with the actual Personal Access Token.

**Repository is ready!** All files are committed and ready to push.
